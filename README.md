# html_js_Visual_Novel_Engine

This is a fairly simple Visual Novel engine built using HTML, javascript. The story is contained in a JSON Object.
It allows you to setup multiple images for characters and locations. This way you can describe a character by thier name and description such as "Tim.Uniform.happy". 
You can have multiple backgrounds for each location so can represent different times of day or events. You can describe them similary to the characters such as School.day or Beach.night.
Of course the Engine allows for creating multiple paths by allowing multi choice response if one chooses or one can set the scene up to use a next but to go to the next scene.

This is a step up on the earlier engine simple_VN in that it allows for character dolls and location settings.
There are 5 character positions left left-center center right-center and right.
